## How to Create a New Component

- Write component code. See [quick start](https://github.com/hyoo-ru/mam_mol#create-your-application-component) to learn main concepts.
- Register it as web-component, [like there](chart/chart.view.ts#L2) to use outside $mol apps.
- Add GitHub Workflow, [like that](.github/workflows/deploy.yml).
- Push it.
